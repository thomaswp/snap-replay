## Video Issues
* repeat: Skip solution doesn't work
* repeatUntil: MCQ gets skipped somehow

## Bugs:

* Don't crash when comments are added.
* Figure out why loading is slow (probably b/c loading audio twice for duration...), speed it up (e.g. buffering?), add load icon
* Disable media play/pause or make it do the right thing.
* Sometimes the "Loading" screen doesn't go away at the end of a video

## Recording Features:
* Comments
* Finish custom blocks
* Finish variables (script, local)
* Fix block drag-n-drop bug where it goes to the pallete again (!)
* Misc mouse movements: sprite dragging
* Scrolling for variable blocks is wrong (!)

## Replayer Features:
* Custom block editor resizing (!)
* Log JS errors (!)
* Self-explanation prompts should be movable so code is visible/interactive
* Copy code buttun for final code
* Add self-explain prompt
* Star rating + feedback on code dialog
* Volume
* Questions
* Progress tracking: `(SELECT MAX(CAST(data AS int)) FROM 'replay' WHERE message='Playback.updatePlaying')`
* Config for maxplayback, show code, logging, etc.
* Let scrubbing happen up to unanswered questions or the end

## Testing:

* Variables:
  * Script vars / renaming
* Conditionals: just test thoroughly
* Procedures
   * Changing block types
   * The created reporter (record/set id)

## Editing:

* Audio transcription editing support
* Splicing in new content
* Debugging features to
